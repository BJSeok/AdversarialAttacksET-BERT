# The repository for the adversarial attack implementations on ET-BERT

This repository covers the implementation of adversarial attacks on ET-BERT proposed at WWW'21.

ET-BERT is a framework for analyzing encrypted traffic based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), proposed at the WWW conference in 2021. Details about ET-BERT and the original ET-BERT implementation can be found at the following repository. link: https://github.com/linwhitehat/ET-BERT

To actually run the implementation in this repository, you must first perform fine-tuning on ET-BERT and install the TextAttack library.

For a detailed explanation of this implementation, please refer to our paper.
